# Paladin

## General Overview

Paladin is a Rust-based, modular content processing platform built with Hexagonal Architecture principles. It provides configurable pipelines to ingest, normalize, analyze, enrich, store, and deliver diverse content types (web pages, documents, feeds, and streams) at scale.

Key capabilities include configurable content ingestion, NLP/LLM analysis and summarization, metadata extraction and subject tagging, content filtering and lifecycle management, and flexible delivery channels (HTTP/webhooks, email, push, and queue-based adapters). Clear ports-and-adapters boundaries make integrations, testing, and replacement of components straightforward. Paladin is designed for content aggregation, monitoring, enrichment, and automated delivery workflows where extensibility, observability, and reliable storage across SQL/NoSQL/file backends are important.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**New in Epic 12**: Paladin now supports automatic RAG integration, enabling agents to retrieve relevant context from long-term memory and extract new memories after execution.

**What is RAG?**
- **Automatic Context Retrieval**: Fetch relevant memories before generating responses
- **Smart Memory Extraction**: Automatically store important facts after conversations
- **Knowledge Building**: Accumulate wisdom across multiple sessions
- **Response Quality**: Improve accuracy with historical context

**Quick Start:**

```yaml
# config.yml
sanctum:
  provider: in_memory  # or 'qdrant' for production

rag:
  top_k: 5                    # Retrieve top 5 relevant memories
  min_similarity: 0.7          # 70% relevance threshold
  max_tokens: 2000             # Context budget
  timeout_seconds: 5           # Retrieval timeout

memory_extraction:
  enabled: true
  strategy: on_completion     # Extract after each conversation
```

**Example Usage:**

```rust
use paladin::application::use_cases::sanctum::{
    RagRetrievalService, MemoryExtractionService
};

// Create RAG services
let rag_service = Arc::new(RagRetrievalService::new(
    sanctum_port, embedding_port, rag_config
));

let extraction_service = Arc::new(MemoryExtractionService::new(
    llm_port, embedding_port, sanctum_port
));

// Configure Paladin with RAG
let execution_service = PaladinExecutionService::new(llm_port)
    .with_rag_retrieval(rag_service)
    .with_memory_extraction(extraction_service);

// Execute with automatic RAG
let result = execution_service.execute(&paladin, "user input").await?;
// ✓ Context automatically retrieved from Sanctum
// ✓ Response generated with historical context
// ✓ New memories extracted and stored
```

**Benefits:**
- 🧠 **Contextual Awareness**: Agents remember previous conversations
- 📈 **Improved Accuracy**: Responses reference historical knowledge
- 🔄 **Automatic**: No manual memory management needed
- ⚙️ **Configurable**: Tune retrieval and extraction parameters
- 🚀 **Scalable**: Works with both in-memory and Qdrant storage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Rust (latest stable version)
* Cargo package manager

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd Paladin
```

### Building

To build the project, run:

```sh
cargo build
```

### Configuration

Paladin uses a dual-path configuration system:
- **YAML files** (`config.yml`) for structural/behavioral settings
- **Environment variables** for secrets and deployment-specific overrides

For detailed configuration instructions, see **[Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)**.

**Quick setup for development:**

```bash
# 1. Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env and add your API keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
# DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-deepseek-key
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key

# 3. The .env file is automatically loaded in debug builds
cargo run
```

**Configuration sources (in priority order):**
1. `config.yml` - Base configuration (committed to git)
2. `APP_*` environment variables - Override any YAML value
3. Direct environment variables - LLM API keys (never in YAML)

For production deployments, CI/CD, and advanced configuration patterns, see the [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

### Running Tests

Run unit tests to ensure functionality:

```sh
cargo test
```

### Live LLM API Tests In DevContainer

Use a workspace `.env` file as the single source of truth instead of one-off `export` commands.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set at least one provider key in `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
```

Load `.env` in your current terminal session:

```bash
set -a
. /workspace/.env
set +a
```

Run live API tests (feature-gated and ignored by default):

```bash
cargo test --features live-api-tests -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Run one provider only:

```bash
cargo test --features live-api-tests test_openai -- --ignored --nocapture
```

    CouncilBuilder, TerminationCondition, TurnStrategy
};
use std::sync::Arc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create expert Paladins for discussion
    let security_expert = create_paladin("SecurityExpert",
        "You are a security expert focused on authentication best practices");
    let legal_expert = create_paladin("LegalExpert",
        "You are a legal expert focused on compliance and privacy regulations");
    let tech_lead = create_paladin("TechLead",
        "You are a technical lead focused on implementation feasibility");

    let paladins = vec![security_expert, legal_expert, tech_lead];

    // Build the Council with structured discussion rules
    let council = CouncilBuilder::new()
        .name("2FA Implementation Council")
        .participants(3)  // Number of participants in the discussion
        .turn_strategy(TurnStrategy::RoundRobin)  // Each expert takes turns
        .termination_condition(TerminationCondition::MaxRounds(3))  // 3 rounds of discussion
        .build()?;

    // Execute the discussion
    let council_service = CouncilExecutionService::new(llm_port);
    let result = council_service.execute(
        &council,
        &paladins,
        "Should we implement two-factor authentication for our application?"
    ).await?;

    // View the discussion transcript
    println!("📜 Discussion Summary:");
    println!("{}", result.summary);
    println!("\n🗣️ Total Turns: {}", result.total_turns);

    Ok(())
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Technical Decisions**: Architecture reviews with security, performance, and maintainability experts

            .with_keywords(vec!["load", "scaling", "throughput"]));

    // Build the Grove with keyword-based routing
    let grove = GroveBuilder::new()
        .name("Expert Task Router")
        .add_tree(security_tree)
        .add_tree(performance_tree)
        .config(GroveConfig {
            routing_strategy: RoutingStrategy::KeywordMatch,
            fallback_tree: Some("Performance Experts".to_string()),
            confidence_threshold: 0.6,
        })
        .build()?;

    // Execute with automatic routing
    let grove_service = GroveExecutionService::new(llm_port);

**Routing Strategies:**
- **KeywordMatch**: Match task keywords to agent expertise (fast, simple)
- **SemanticSimilarity**: Use embeddings for context-aware routing (accurate, requires embedding model)
- **PerformanceBased**: Route based on past agent success rates (adaptive, requires history)

**Use Cases:**
- **Help Desk Routing**: Direct questions to specialized support teams
- **Code Analysis**: Route to language-specific or domain experts
- **Multi-Domain Systems**: Different expert trees for frontend, backend, DevOps, security
- **Customer Support**: Route tickets based on product area or issue type

See `examples/grove_routing.rs` and `examples/commander_grove.rs` for complete working examples.

### Arsenal Tool System Example

```rust
use paladin::application::use_cases::arsenal::ArsenalRegistryService;
use paladin::application::ports::output::arsenal_port::ArsenalRegistry;
use paladin::infrastructure::adapters::arsenal::Armament;
use std::sync::Arc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create tool registry
    let registry = Arc::new(ArsenalRegistryService::new());

    // Register a calculator tool
    let calculator = Armament {
        name: "calculator".to_string(),
        description: "Performs basic arithmetic operations".to_string(),
        parameters: serde_json::json!({
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "operation": {"type": "string", "enum": ["add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"]},
                "a": {"type": "number"},
                "b": {"type": "number"}
            },
            "required": ["operation", "a", "b"]
        }),
        required_params: vec!["operation".to_string(), "a".to_string(), "b".to_string()],
    };

    registry.register(calculator).await;

    // Paladin agents can now use the calculator tool via function calling
    Ok(())
}
```

See [docs/ARSENAL.md](docs/ARSENAL.md) for comprehensive tool system documentation.

### Notification Example

```rust
let notification_request = NotificationRequest {
    recipient: NotificationRecipient::Email("user@example.com".to_string()),
    content: NotificationContent {
        title: "Welcome!".to_string(),
        body: "Thank you for joining Paladin.".to_string(),
        category: "info".to_string(),
        action_url: None,
        attachments: None,
        template_id: None,
        template_variables: None,
    },
    channel: NotificationChannel::Email,
    priority: NotificationPriority::Normal,
    scheduled_time: None,
    expiry_time: None,
    metadata: None,
};

let response = notification_service.send_notification(notification_request)?;
```

### Content Delivery Example

```rust
let delivery_request = DeliveryRequest {
    recipient_id: "user123".to_string(),
    delivery_method: DeliveryMethod::Http {
        endpoint: "https://example.com/webhook".to_string(),
        headers: None,
    },
    content_payload: ContentPayload::Notification(NotificationContent {
        title: "Notification Title".to_string(),
        body: "Content body".to_string(),
        category: "update".to_string(),
        action_url: None,
        expires_at: None,
    }),
    priority: DeliveryPriority::Normal,
    scheduled_time: None,
    metadata: None,
};

let delivery_response = content_delivery_service.deliver_content(delivery_request)?;
```
